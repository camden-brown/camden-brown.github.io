## About Me

Hi, I’m Camden. I live in Cookeville, Tennessee and build software with the same curiosity that first pulled me into games and systems as a kid. I’m a proud dad to two amazing adopted sons, and most of my favorite adventures now start (and end) with my family.

## Personal Snapshot

- Father of 2 (international adoption – South Korea)  
- Cookeville, TN based (Tennessee Tech alum)  
- Self‑taught programmer (relentless, iterative learner)  
- Former EverQuest player; still enjoy a good competitive session of Overwatch now and then  
- Goal‑driven: always setting the next measurable milestone  
- Family travel & adventure enthusiast  

## What Drives Me

I’m a goal‑oriented craftsman—always raising the bar, always learning. Right now that means exploring Go for the challenge and breadth. I have a persistent drive to execute, refine, and hit the targets I set, pairing curiosity with disciplined follow‑through.

## Outside the Editor

Away from work I keep things active and family-centered:

- Skateboarding with my kids
- Video games (recent Claire 33 clear)
- Family travel: Thailand, Korea, Hawaii, US national parks
- Strength & conditioning to stay healthy and present
- Overlanding / camping in a 4Runner with the kids
- Short local trips between bigger adventures

## Operating Style

I bias toward action with a high bar for correctness. I like to deeply model a system, set a target, then move fast inside clearly understood risk boundaries.

Key themes:
- Proactive & ownership-driven: push initiatives without waiting for permission.
- Analytical depth: won’t commit until I understand edge cases and failure modes.
- High precision: patterns, guardrails, coverage (~80%) to keep velocity clean.
- Intolerance for waste: automate or eliminate repetitive workflows.
- Direct communication: concise, factual, outcome-focused—not big on filler.
- Independent but collaborative: prefer autonomy, surface decisions early.
- System optimizer: always tightening feedback loops (build → measure → refine).
- Comfortable with hard problems; less interested in perpetual routine work.

What this means working with me:
- I’ll challenge ambiguity and push for explicit contracts.
- I reduce risk through instrumentation, tests, and iterative rollout.
- I protect deep work blocks to accelerate complex delivery.
- I expect accountability (including from myself) and clear ownership lines.
